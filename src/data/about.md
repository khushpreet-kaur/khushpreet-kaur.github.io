# Intro

A girl from a border village of Punjab. I am passionate about almost everything. I write code and spend most of my time finding solutions to my problems. I love to restrospect. 
If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

I am learning to write quality code, build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, I primarily work as a software engineer.

# Some history

My uncle/ਫੁੱਫੜ ਜੀ (Dad's sister's husband) gifted me a computer in 2005 when I was in school. I had seen a computer that used to lay in my school's computer lab, I have no idea why weren't we allowed to go into that lab and use a computer, probably the school had no money to get it repaired if anything was done wrong by students - so computer lab was more like a temple, we had to remove our shoes and sit quietly and watch our teacher clicking on the screen.  Even then, I would eagerly wait for computer class.  
Anyway, I used MS paint a lot on my computer and mostly drew huts, some smileys and many more childish drawing.  My favourite games were Mario, and Tom and Jerry. Since the computer was shared by me and my brother - he mostly played some Harry potter, and car racing games - I could never beat him in those :/  
Basically, I had always wondered but never really knew how to write code until my graduation. Probably, when a geeky kid was developing computer games, I was playing outdoors and I don't regret it. I believe there's no age to learn anything - I learn everyday!
